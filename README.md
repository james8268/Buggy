The Buggy has 3 main forms forms of interaction; a remote mode where the buggy can be controlled by the user through Bluetooth/WiFi/IR commands, an autonomous mode where the buggy is commanded by the user to roam freely without colliding into obstacles and a measureing more where the buggy will move around autonomously but will take temperature and water level reading when it stops itself due to an obstacle. 

The IR remote is the most simple way of interacting with the buggy.
